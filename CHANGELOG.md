# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- LP and convex `solve`/`make_solver`: `diag_adapt` (with `diag_theta` and
  `diag_clamp`), a per-coordinate diagonal step metric on top of the scaling,
  adapted at each restart. The convex solver supports it only for adaptive
  extragradient with restarts, and leaves it off by default.

### Changed

- LP `solve`/`make_solver`: `diag_adapt=True` is the default. On the MIPLIB
  2017 LP set it certifies 380/383 presolved instances (376 before) and cuts
  the shifted geometric-mean solve time from 8.62 s to 7.04 s.

## 0.2.1

### Changed

- Convex `solve`: a solve that meets its convergence criteria now reports
  `stop_reason="certificate"`, as the LP solver does, instead of
  `"converged"`.
- Convex `solve` no longer prints its end-of-solve summary unless
  `verbose=True`. In both solvers the max-epochs and time-limit messages are
  printed only with `verbose=True`; the Ctrl-C notice is still always printed.

### Added

- `CITATION.cff`, for GitHub's "Cite this repository".
- Docstrings for `jaddle_linear.to_jaddle_sparse`,
  `jaddle_linear.lp_summary_statistics` and the optimisers in
  `jaddle_optimisers`.

## 0.2.0

### Added

**LP solver (`jaddle.jaddle_linear`)**

- `load`: read an MPS or LP file into a `JaddleLP`, optionally presolved by
  HiGHS.
- `solve_with_presolve`: HiGHS presolve, a Jaddle solve of the reduced LP and
  HiGHS postsolve of the primal and dual solution. The result is certified on
  the LP as given (`converged`), with the reduced solve's verdict in
  `reduced_converged`. Options `polish=True` and `run_crossover=True`.
- `crossover`: take a first-order solution to an optimal basic solution with
  HiGHS.
- `detect_infeasibility` and `evaluate_infeasibility_certificate`: PDLP-style
  primal and dual infeasibility detection.
- Batched and differentiable solves: `make_solver`, `solve_batch`,
  `make_optimal_value`, `make_solution`, `make_perturbed_solution`, the
  `LPValues` pytree and `SolveCoreResult`.
- `solve_with_polishing` now takes the three certificate tolerances, a time
  limit and an objective row for the primal polish
  (`polish_objective_slack`), with a configurable trigger (`polish_trigger`,
  `first_polish_epoch`, `polish_ready_factor`, `polish_fraction`).
- `evaluate_lp_certificate` takes `norm` and `dual_residual`.

**Convex solver (`jaddle.jaddle_convex`)**

- `quadratic_program`: QPs from `Q`, `c` and constraint matrices, with
  symmetric KKT equilibration and an LP-style certificate in the problem's
  own units.
- Batched and differentiable solves: `make_solver`, `make_optimal_value`,
  `make_solution` and `SolveCoreResult`.
- `report_best` (default on): test and return whichever of the average and the
  last iterate has the lower KKT merit.
- `JaddleCP` takes an optional `residuals` function to supply a problem's own
  stopping test.

**HiGHS helpers (`jaddle.highs_helpers`)**

- `read_model`, `jaddle_lp_to_highs`, `highs_duals_to_jaddle`,
  `jaddle_duals_to_highs`, `standard_form_row_map` and
  `standard_form_basis_to_highs`.

**Examples**

- `lp/battery_sizing.py`, `cp/lasso_regression.py`,
  `cp/fair_logistic_regression.py` and `cp/kernel_svm.py`.
- `lp/miplib.py` replaces `lp/miplib_standard.py`.

### Changed

- LP and convex `solve`: `epochs_per_restart` now defaults to `None` (no cap
  on the restart cycle length) instead of `10`.
- Convex `solve`: `update_mode` defaults to `"alternating"` instead of
  `"extragradient"`, and `average` defaults to `True`.
- The LP iteration loop runs on the device in chunks of about a second, which
  makes solves 2–3× faster. Runs are no longer bit-identical to 0.1.0's after
  a restart.

### Removed

- LP `solve`: `eq_projection_threshold`.
- `solve_with_polishing`: `max_rounds`.

### Fixed

- LP `solve`: the relative dual feasibility residual left out the cost
  normalisation factor. Under the default augmented scaling the factor is
  close to 1, but with `scaled_augmented=False` the solver could report false
  certificates.
- LP `solve`: a warm start's duals were mapped into the scaled problem without
  the cost normalisation factor, so warm starts did not start from the point
  supplied.

## 0.1.0
